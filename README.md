Project: Blog with a commenting and reply section. Also includes an admin section.

Project: Pending

Technologies that will be used:

1) Python 3.5
2) Database MongoDB
3) Flask
4) Pymongo (ORM)
5) Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript for the admin panel interface
6) Selenium -> for automatic testing
 7) Microsoft word (Manual testing)
 8) Excel (Manual testing)
 
 In this section I am going to build a complete blog from the ground up.
 The blog will contain a section where users can comment as well as 
 replying to comments. I will also include an admin interface built using
 bootstrap.
 
 
 I will also be using a combination of testing. This will include  
 automatic testing, unit tests, manual testing, regression testing, exploration testing, 
 black box testing, white box testing, etc. After all an application without any
 tests is not worth writing.
