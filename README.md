Project: Blog with a commenting and reply section. Also includes an admin section.

Project: Pending

Technologies that will be used:

1) Python 3.5
2) Database MongoDB
3) Flask
4) Pymongo (ORM)
5) Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript for the admin panel interface
6) Selenium -> for automatic testing
 7) Microsoft word (Manual testing)
 8) Excel (Manual testing)
 
 In this section I am going to build a complete blog from the ground up.
 The blog will contain a section where users can comment as well as 
 replying to comments. I will also include an admin interface built using
 bootstrap.
 
 
 I will also be using a combination of testing. This will include  
 automatic testing, unit tests, manual testing, regression testing, exploration testing, 
 black box testing, white box testing, etc. After all an application without any
 tests is not worth writing.
  
 
 Installing
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 1) To run the blog either create a virtual environment on your computer. Note this is optional.
 
 To create a virtual environment on **Linux** go to folder you like to create the virtual environment in
 and run the command:  **virtualenv 'type what name you like to call your virtual environment here without quotes' -p python3**
 
 This will create a virtual environment.
 
 2) If you have installed virtual environment activate it by use this command below or skip to step 3:
 **source 'The name of your virtual environment'/bin/activate**
 
3) Next run the command: **pip install -r requirement.txt**
 This will download all the depencides needed to run the blog.
 
 4) Open a new browser and type in the url box: **http://127.0.0.1:5000**.
