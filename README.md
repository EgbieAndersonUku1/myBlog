Project: Pending

Technologies that will be used:

1) Python 3.5
2) Database MongoDB
3) Flask

5) Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, JavaScript for the admin panel interface
6) Selenium -> for automatic testing

 In this section I am going to build a complete blog from the ground up.
 The blog will contain a section where users can comment as well as 
 replying to comments. I will also include an admin interface built using
 bootstrap.
 
 
 I will also be using a combination of testing. This will include  
 automatic testing, unit tests, manual testing, regression testing, exploration testing, 
 black box testing, white box testing, etc.
